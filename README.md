# Raleway : FPM Font Package

This repository contains a [fpm font package](https://fpm.dev/featured/fonts/) containing [Google Font: 
Raleway]https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway/about?query=ralew).

Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface family. Initially designed by Matt McInerney as a single thin weight, it was expanded into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida in 2012 and iKerned by Igino Marini. A thorough review and italic was added in 2016.

It is a display face and the download features both old style and lining numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than its neo-grotesque inspired default character set.



Designers: Matt McInerney, Pablo Impallari, Rodrigo Fuenzalida
